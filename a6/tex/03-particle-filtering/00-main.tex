\item {\bf Particle Filtering}

Though exact inference works well for the small maps, it wastes a lot of effort
computing probabilities for {\em every available tile}, even for tiles that are
unlikely to have a car on them.  We can solve this problem using a particle
filter. Updates to the particle filter have complexity that's linear in the
number of particles, rather than linear in the number of tiles.

For a great conceptual explanation of how particle filtering works, check out

filtering to estimate an airplane's altitude. 

In this problem, you'll implement two short but important methods for the
|ParticleFilter| class in |submission.py|. When you're finished, your code
should be able to track cars nearly as effectively as it does with exact
inference.

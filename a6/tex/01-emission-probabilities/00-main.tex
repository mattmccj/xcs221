\item {\bf Emission Probabilities}

In this problem, we assume that the other car is stationary (e.g., $C_t =
C_{t-1}$ for all time steps $t$). You will implement a function |observe| that
upon observing a new distance measurement $D_t = d_t$ updates the current
posterior probability from
\[\mathbb P(C_t \mid D_1 = d_1, \dots, D_{t-1} = d_{t-1})\]

to
\[\mathbb P(C_t \mid D_1 = d_1, \dots, D_t = d_t) \propto \mathbb P(C_t \mid D_1
= d_1, \dots, D_{t-1} = d_{t-1}) p(d_t \mid c_t),\]

where we have multiplied in the emission probabilities $p(d_t \mid c_t)$
described earlier under ``Modeling car locations". The current posterior
probability is stored as |self.belief| in |ExactInference|.

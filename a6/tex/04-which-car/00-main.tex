\item {\bf Which Car is it?}

So far, we have assumed that we have a distinct noisy distance reading for each
car, but in reality, our microphone would just pick up an undistinguished set of
these signals, and we wouldn't know which distance reading corresponds to which
car. First, let's extend the notation from before: let $C_{ti} \in \mathbb R^2$
be the location of the $i$-th car at the time step $t$, for $i = 1, \dots, K$
and $t = 1, \dots, T$. Recall that all the cars move independently according to
the transition dynamics as before.

Let $D_{ti} \in \mathbb R$ be the noisy distance measurement of the $i$-th car
at time step $t$, which is now not directly observed. Instead, we observe the
{\bf set} of distances $D_t = \{ D_{t1}, \dots, D_{tK} \}$.  (For simplicity,
we'll assume that all distances are distinct values.) Alternatively, you can
think of $E_t = (E_{t1}, \dots, E_{tK})$ as a list which is a uniformly random
permutation of the noisy distances $(D_{t1}, \dots, D_{tK})$. For example,
suppose $K=2$ and $T = 2$. Before, we might have gotten distance readings of $1$
and $2$ for the first car and $3$ and $4$ for the second car at time steps $1$
and $2$, respectively. Now, our sensor readings would be permutations of $\{1,
3\}$ (at time step $1$) and $\{2, 4\}$ (at time step $2$). Thus, even if we knew
the second car was distance $3$ away at time $t = 1$, we wouldn't know if it
moved further away (to distance $4$) or closer (to distance $2$) at time $t =
2$.

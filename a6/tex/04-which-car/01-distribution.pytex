Suppose we have $K=2$ cars and one time step $T=1$. Write an expression for the
conditional distribution $\mathbb P(C_{11}, C_{12} \mid E_1 = e_1)$ as a
function of the PDF of a Gaussian $p_{\mathcal N}(v; \mu, \sigma^2)$
and the prior probability $p(c_{11})$ and $p(c_{12})$ over car locations. Your
final answer should not contain variables $d_{11}$, $d_{12}$.

Remember that $p_{\mathcal N}(v; \mu, \sigma^2)$ is the probability of
a random variable, $v$, in a Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard
deviation $\sigma$.

{\em Hint: for $K=1$, the answer would be
\[\mathbb P(C_{11} = c_{11} \mid E_1 = e_1) \propto p(c_{11}) p_{\mathcal N}
(e_{11}; \|a_1 - c_{11}\|, \sigma^2).\]

where $a_t$ is the position of the car at time t. You might find it useful to
draw the Bayesian network and think about the distribution of $E_t$ given
$D_{t1}, \dots, D_{tK}$.}

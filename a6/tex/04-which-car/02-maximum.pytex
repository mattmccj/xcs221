\item \points{4b}
Assuming the prior $p(c_{1i})$ of where the cars start out is the same for all
$i$ (i.e. for all K cars), show that the number of assignments for all $K$ cars
$(c_{11}, \dots, c_{1K})$ that obtain the maximum value of $\mathbb P(C_{11} =
c_{11}, \dots, C_{1K} = c_{1K} \mid E_1 = e_1)$ is at least $K!$.

You can also assume that the car locations that maximize the probability above
are unique ($C_{1i} \neq c_{1j}$ for all $i \neq j$).

{\em Note: you don't need to produce a complicated proof for this question.
It is acceptable to provide a clear explanation based on your intuitive understanding of the scenario.}

\item \points{4c}
For general $K$, what is the treewidth corresponding to the posterior
distribution over all $K$ car locations at all $T$ time steps conditioned on all
the sensor readings:
\[\mathbb P(C_{11} = c_{11}, \dots, C_{1K} = c_{1K}, \dots, C_{T1} = c_{T1}, \dots, C_{TK} = c_{TK} \mid E_1 = e_1, \dots, E_T = e_T)?\]
Briefly justify your answer.

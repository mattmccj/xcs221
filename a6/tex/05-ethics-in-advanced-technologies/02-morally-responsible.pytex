\item \points{5b}
Dual-use technologies are technologies that serve two purposes, typically a military and a civilian purpose.
Researchers developing dual-use technologies face a moral dilemma: though they may intend to improve only the
peaceful use of the technology, any improvements they make aid others who use the technology in war or in
non-state attacks or killings. Tracking of the kind developed in this assignment can be used in self-driving
cars or in autonomous weapons systems, such as lethal drones that track people to kill them.\\

Imagine a researcher who develops a dual-use technology despite knowing about the lethal secondary use of
the technology and despite the researcher considering this secondary use unethical. Would the researcher
be partially morally responsible for  improvements to the lethal use of the technology that result from
their discoveries?  If not, give one reason why not. If so, explain why they are partially responsible and
explain what action(s) the researcher should take to address this (choosing another line of research,
building a safeguard, or other)?

\textbf{What we expect:} A 3-6 sentence response that
\begin{itemize}
    \item answers yes or no to whether the researcher would be partially morally responsible
    \item provides a reason why they would or would not be partially morally responsible
    \item if yes, describes an action they should take
\end{itemize}

\item \points{5a}
You are in charge of public policy for an autonomous vehicle company headquartered in California. 
Your engineering team is making progress in designing a fully automated vehicle and would like to test it on real
roadways. California would require that you apply for autonomous vehicle testing permits and meet regulatory
standards designed to protect the safety of other motorists and pedestrians. Given these regulations,
testing your vehicles in California secretly without a permit would be illegal.
The Governor of Arizona has reached out to offer your company testing in the state without restrictions. 
Doing so would allow you to test more quickly and without making any changes to your vehicles\footnote{\href{https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/28/uber-arizona-secret-self-driving-program-governor-doug-ducey}{link}}. On the other hand,
testing in Arizona could be considered ‚Äúethics dumping,‚Äù namely ‚Äúdoing research deemed unethical in a scientist‚Äôs
home country in a country or region with laxer ethical rules‚Äù and regulations\footnote{Thanks to Rob Reich for this example. For a discussion of ethics dumping, see \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05616-w}{this}}. \\


Would testing in Arizona be ‚Äúethics dumping‚Äù? Be sure to explain why you think it is  or isn‚Äôt.
Given your answer to this question and other factors you consider to be relevant, should you perform your
tests in Arizona or comply with Californian standards? Justify your answer with a reason as to why. 

\textbf{What we expect:} In 3-6 sentences, we expect:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a yes or no answer to the ethics dumping question
    \item an explanation of why it is or isn‚Äôt ethics dumping given the definition above
    \item a yes or no answer to whether the tests should be done in Arizona or California
    \item an explanation that justifies why the tests should be done in Arizona or California<
\end{itemize}

\item \points{2a}
Finish |ExactInference| by implementing the |elapseTime| method. When you are
all done, you should be able to track a moving car well enough to drive
autonomously by running the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
python drive.py -a -d -k 1 -i exactInference
\end{lstlisting}

{\em Notes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item You can also drive autonomously in the presence of more than one car:
\begin{lstlisting}
python drive.py -a -d -k 3 -i exactInference
\end{lstlisting}

  \item You can also drive down Lombard:
\begin{lstlisting}
python drive.py -a -d -k 3 -i exactInference -l lombard
\end{lstlisting}

  On Lombard, the autonomous driver may attempt to drive up and down the street
  before heading towards the target area. Again, focus on the car tracking
  component, instead of the actual driving.
\end{itemize}
